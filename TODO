o memset() won't cause ->state to be _DEF because we can't/don't
  catch these memwrite instructions. sol'n: add memset() to 
  our library. else you get false BADREAD errors.

o wrap realloc() calloc() valloc() memalign() 

o wrap memset() memcpy() memcmp() memmove() str*() so that
  we record the fact that they have "touched" memory.
